# Solving-TSP-with-Evolutionary-Genetic-Algorithm-Heuristic-Python  
solving TSP (traveling sales man) using genetic algorithm in python  
using heuristic algorithm to solve high dimensional tsp problem   
**Cities are included in "Cities List.txt" in repo to add or remove cities you've got to include or exclude cities in every line like:  "1 909 649"  
    First number is city index and next two numbers are city euclidean coordinates: x,y which are set to 0 to 1000 but you can change the range to any range
    The distance between cities are calculated by Euclidean Distance which is:

**I look forward to you questions about the project!**
